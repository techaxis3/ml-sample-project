# ML Project Notes

This file contains short notes about the sample ML project.

- The dataset `dataset/data.csv` is a tiny example for demo purposes.
- `src/train_model.py` is a simple script that loads the CSV and computes dummy metrics.
- Replace the dummy code with real preprocessing, training loops, and evaluation for a real project.
